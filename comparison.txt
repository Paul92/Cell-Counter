                    Git revert and Git reset

    I. Git Revert

    Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the related patches
introduce, and record some new commits that record them. This requires your working
tree to be clean (no modfications from the HEAD commit).

    git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the effect of some
earlier commits (often only a faulty one).

    Types : 
    
    --continue
        Continue the operation in progress using the information in .git/sequencer.
Can be used to continue after resolving conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.

    --quit
        Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used to clear the 
sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or revert.

    --abort
        Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence state.

    II. Git Reset

    The form git reset [<mode>] [<commit>] resets the current branch head to
<commit> and possibly updates the index (resetting it to the tree of <commit>)
and the working tree depending on <mode>. If <mode> is ommited, defaults to
"--mixed". The <mode> must be one of the following :

    --soft
        Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the
head to <commit>, just like all mode do). This leaves all your changed files 
"Changeds to be commited", as git status would put it.

    --mixed
        Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are
preserved but not marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated. This
is the default action.

    --hard
        Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the
working tree since <commit> are discarded.

    --merge
        Resets the index and updates the files in the working tree that are 
different between <commit> and HEAD, but keeps those which are different between
the index and working tree (i.e. which have changes which have not been added).
If a file that is different between <commit> and the index has unstaged changes,
reset is aborted.

    --keep
        Resets index entries and updates files in the working tree that are 
different between <commit>. If a file that is different between <commit> and HEAD
has local changes, reset is aborted.
